1. **algocode**: contains the main code for the Pelican Optimization Algorithm.

2. **functionscores**: code similar to that of /algocode/, along with a *writer.py* file. The *writer.py* script generates text files containing the best scores obtained for each test function. These files are stored within the *./scores/* directory.

3. **pressurevesseldesign**: contains a modified algorithm for solving the Pressure Vessel Design Engineering problem. Also includes a *writer.py* file for storing best scores and solutions.
